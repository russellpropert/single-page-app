# single-page-app

## Description
A basic single page app demo that features a nav bar and fragment navigation. The views within the page are all bootstrap templates. The blog route has a secondary nav bar to navigate within the page.

## How To Run
This exercise can be run by forking the repository and cloning it to your machine. If you don't have npm installed, you can get it by installing node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Run 'npx http-server' from the command line to run a temporary http-server or install http-server as a global command by running 'npm install --global http-server' (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server). Run 'http-server' to start a server. Run 'http-server -c-1' to prevent the browser from caching if you want to make changes. You can then access the page by going to localhost:8080 in your web browser.
